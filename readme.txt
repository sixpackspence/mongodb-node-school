This is just a simple Blog site that can teach anyone the simple stuff about sending and receiving data from a database, plus some more advanced concepts that I still am trying to grasp

this was quite the challenge watched several videos trying to figure out exactly how all this links up, still pretty confusing lol, but I definetly got the hang of linking to DB's

one of the biggest challenges of this whole thing was figuring out what calls what and what to output and how to ouput thing, even watching several videos this stuff can be a challenge but I am getting the hang of it.
